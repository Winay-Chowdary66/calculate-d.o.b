# calculate-d.o.b
 Ask the user for their birthday. It will probably be easiest to ask year, then month, then day rather than parsing a combined string reliably. a.      Calculate the age of the user. Check to see if the age of the user is impossible. For example, if the user is not yet born, or age is greater than 100, display an error message. b.      Output the age of the user to the console. c.       And if the entered user month and date matches the current system date, then display a birthday message to the user on console.
